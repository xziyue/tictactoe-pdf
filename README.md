# PDF-based Tic-tac-toe Game

Download [tic-tac-toe.pdf](./tic-tac-toe.pdf) and start playing!

## Generation of document

1. All valid tic-tac-toe states are generated by `generate_tictactoe/tictactoe.cpp`.
The results should be saved in `generate_tictactoe/tictactoe.txt`.
2. Run `generate_tictactoe.py` to generate LaTeX source file `tic-tac-toe.tex`.
3. Compile `tic-tac-toe.tex`.

## Version 2

I have improved the quality of AI so that the player is impossible to win. The newer version can be seen in `tic-tac-toe2.pdf`.
